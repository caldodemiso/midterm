          Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover - B), was a
          robotic rover that was part of
          <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA's</a> Mars
          Exploration Rover program. It landed on Mars on January 25, 2004,
          three weeks after its twin, Spirit (MER-A), touched down on the
          opposite side of the planet. <br /><br />Opportunity's primary mission
          was to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils
          that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. The rover exceeded its
          planned 90-day mission duration by far, continuing its exploration and
          scientific discoveries for nearly 15 years until communication was
          lost on June 10, 2018. <br /><br />Opportunity made groundbreaking
          discoveries about the year Planet's geology and environment, including
          evidence that Mars once had conditions that could have supported
          microbial life.

            <h3>Blueberries on Mars</h3>
            <p>
              The rover discovered small spherical objects, nicknamed
              "blueberries," which are hematite-rich spherules. These provided
              strong evidence that liquid water once flowed on the surface of
              Mars, as they are believed to have formed in wet ground
              conditions.

            <p>
              Discovered in January 2005, this was the first meteorite ever
              identified on another planet. Officially named "Meridiani Planum,"
              it is an iron meteorite about the size of a basketball. The
              discovery was significant because it provided direct evidence of
              meteoritic material on Mars, offering clues about the history of
              meteorite impacts on the planet and the composition of materials
              in the solar system.

            <h3>Sulfate-rich Sandstones</h3>
            <p>
              Opportunity discovered sulfate-rich sandstones at various
              locations, including the Meridiani Planum. These sandstones were
              indicative of the presence of acidic water in the past. Sulfates
              form in liquid water environments, and their abundance suggested
              that Mars had long-standing, possibly stationary, bodies of water
              such as lakes or shallow seas that were acidic.

          After months of attempting to reestablish contact, NASA officially
          declares the Opportunity mission complete.<br />Throughout its
          mission, Opportunity traveled over 28 miles, sending back invaluable
          data about Mars' geology, atmosphere, and potential for past water.
          This timeline encapsulates the rover's enduring legacy and its
          contributions to our understanding of the Red Planet.
